There is no part of the code that I've noticed as being non-functional.

I don't see any part that is overly inefficient.

One important lesson was that one can use another object, such as a HasMap, to hold a metric in order to use it to compare the elements.

Most challenging aspect was probably implement Dijkstra's algorithm itself. While I did have the pseudocode that was given in class it still confused me a bit when writing it in code. I needed to rewrite a large portion as I wrote it wrong originally. Additionally, due to how I implemented it the lines were getting very long which didn't help. I managed to shorten them though.
